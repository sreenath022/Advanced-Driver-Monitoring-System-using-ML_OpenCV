# Advanced-Driver-Monitoring-System-using-ML_OpenCV

In this project, we developed a driver drowsiness detection system using Machine Learning. The model

 was trained to recognize signs of drowsiness and yawning, triggering an alarm when these are detected.
 
 This system aims to enhance road safety by alerting drivers before they fall asleep. The solution
 
 combines real-time monitoring with an e ective alert mechanism to prevent accidents.
